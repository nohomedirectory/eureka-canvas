# AGENTS.md — Eureka Canvas

**Project:** Eureka Canvas — spatial thinking workspace with Gemini Live API
**Hackathon:** Gemini Live Agent Challenge (Devpost)
**Category:** Live Agents
**Deadline:** March 16, 2026, 5:00 PM PDT (submit by 4:00 PM PDT — 1-hour buffer)
**Prize target:** Grand Prize ($25,000 + Google Cloud Next stage demo)

---

## What This Is

A voice-first spatial canvas where Gemini silently crystallizes the user's spoken thoughts into visual cards, clusters them via force-directed physics, creates synthesis insights, runs background research, and schedules Calendar events. The agent doesn't respond to you — it thinks alongside you. The canvas IS the interface, not a chat thread.

**The spec (`spec.md`) is the single source of truth for all implementation details.** Read it before working on any bead. The README (`README.md`) is the judge-facing document — do not modify it without checking spec consistency.

---

## Stack

| Layer | Tech |
|-------|------|
| Frontend | Next.js (App Router), React, TypeScript |
| Canvas | Absolutely-positioned divs, CSS transforms, SVG edges, d3-force |
| Voice | AudioWorklet (48kHz→16kHz capture), Web Audio API (24kHz→system rate playback) |
| Backend | Node.js on Google Cloud Run, WebSocket proxy |
| Model | `gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview-12-2025` via Gemini Live API |
| SDK | `@google/genai` (Google GenAI SDK) — **required by hackathon rules** |
| Persistence | Google Cloud Firestore |
| Research | Separate `generateContent` call with Google Search grounding |
| External action | Google Calendar API (pre-authorized OAuth) |
| Layout physics | d3-force (~50 lines) |

---

## HARD RULES — EVERY AGENT MUST FOLLOW THESE

### Rule 1: Effective P0 — What MUST Ship for the Demo

The spec has P0/P1/P2 tiers, but the demo script (spec §13.2) requires features from P1. **For this build, the following are ALL treated as P0:**

From spec P0 (§4.3):
- Canvas with artifact rendering and drag support
- Voice session plumbing (AudioWorklet capture, playback, transcript)
- Live API function-call loop
- `create_card`, `move_artifact`, `create_calendar_event` tools
- Agent persona and silent crystallization behavior
- Card creation animations (ghost → solid, 300ms)
- Firestore persistence
- Cloud Run deployment (`--timeout=3600 --min-instances=1`)
- User drag detection → context injection with edge creation
- Synthesis cards (status: "synthesis", dashed border, triggered at 5+ cards)

**Promoted from P1 to effective P0** (required by demo shots):
- **Force-directed semantic layout** (d3-force) — demo Shot 2 and Shot 5
- **Canvas replay** (state snapshots + timeline scrubber) — demo Shot 5
- **Topology analysis injection** — demo Shot 2 (agent's insight comes from this)
- **Research cascading** (results as individual cards entering force simulation) — demo Shot 4
- **`start_research_job` with Google Search grounding** — demo Shot 4
- **Blog post + deploy script + GDG signup** — +1.0 bonus points (10% of max score)
- **Demo video recording + editing** — this IS the submission

**Everything else is P2. Do NOT build P2 features.** Specifically, do NOT build:
- `group_artifacts` tool
- Multi-view transformations
- `delete_artifact` and undo
- Task DAG rendering
- Thinking budget indicator
- Dynamic system instruction mutation (P1 #7 — nice but not in demo script)
- On-demand canvas screenshots (P1 #4 — spatial refs work from structured state)
- Light/dark theme toggle (P1 #8)

### Rule 2: Audio Pipeline is the Critical Path

**Nothing works without the audio pipeline.** No cards, no voice, no tools, no demo. The dependency chain is:

```
AudioWorklet capture → WebSocket to backend → Backend proxy to Gemini Live API → Tool calls work → Everything else
```

**If you are working on a bead that requires a live Gemini session and the audio pipeline is not yet green, STOP.** Work on canvas UI with mock data, backend infrastructure, or non-code deliverables instead.

**Canvas UI beads CAN proceed with mock data.** Create mock tool call responses and render cards, animations, force layout, replay — all without a live session. Integration beads will wire them together later.

### Rule 3: Default to BLOCKING Tools

The spec documents two approaches for silent card creation:
- **NON_BLOCKING + FunctionResponseScheduling.SILENT** — elegant but unreliable (known API issue: model narrates during tool execution)
- **BLOCKING (default)** — simple, guaranteed silent during tool execution

**Default to BLOCKING for all canvas tools.** The model literally cannot speak while a blocking tool executes. After the response, the system prompt's "NEVER narrate tool calls" instruction handles silence.

This means:
- Do NOT set `behavior: Behavior.NON_BLOCKING` on canvas tool declarations
- Do NOT use `FunctionResponseScheduling` in tool responses
- Do NOT implement "during speech" vs "after pause" scheduling logic
- The system prompt + blocking behavior provides silence

**If time permits and all P0 beads are done,** an upgrade bead can switch to NON_BLOCKING + SILENT. But do not build for it initially.

**IMPORTANT:** The README and spec reference NON_BLOCKING + SILENT extensively. That's correct for the judge-facing documentation (it shows SDK knowledge). The implementation takes the reliable BLOCKING path. These are not contradictory — the README describes the architecture, the code takes the pragmatic path.

### Rule 4: Project Scaffold Bead Must Complete First

Before any implementation bead can start, the project must have:
- `package.json` with all dependencies (`next`, `react`, `@google/genai`, `d3-force`, `firebase-admin`, `googleapis`, `ws`, `uuid`)
- `tsconfig.json` with strict TypeScript
- `next.config.js` (or `.mjs`) with WebSocket support config
- `.env.example` with all required env vars
- Directory structure matching README §Repository structure
- `.gitignore`
- `spec.md` and `README.md` copied into repo root

**No other bead should be claimed until scaffold is green.**

### Rule 5: Calendar OAuth is a Human Checkpoint

The Google Calendar integration requires OAuth credentials that no agent can create. The code should:
- Accept `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` from environment
- Implement the OAuth flow + token refresh in code
- Assume a pre-authorized refresh token will be available at runtime

There is a human checkpoint bead: "Create OAuth credentials in Google Cloud Console, authorize test account, store refresh token." This bead is assigned to the human and blocks the Calendar integration test bead, but NOT the Calendar code bead.

### Rule 6: Verify Model Name Early

`gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview-12-2025` has a December 2025 date suffix. The very first bead that connects to the Gemini API must verify this model name resolves. If it doesn't, check [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) or the SDK docs for the current native audio preview model. Update `.env` and `README.md` if the name has changed.

---

## Architecture Decisions — FINAL, DO NOT REVISIT

These are from spec §16. Do not spend cycles debating them:

| Decision | Choice |
|----------|--------|
| Architecture | Server proxy (NOT client-direct) |
| API auth | Gemini Developer API (API key, not Vertex AI) |
| API version | `v1alpha` (required for Proactive Audio config) |
| Audio capture | AudioWorklet with downsample, NOT MediaRecorder |
| Audio playback | Web Audio API at system default rate, resample from 24kHz |
| Canvas | Absolutely-positioned divs + CSS transforms, NOT canvas element |
| Layout | d3-force with direct DOM manipulation during simulation, sync to React state after settle |
| Coordinates | (0,0) at viewport center, ~1200×800 visible area |
| Ghost cards | 300ms solidification, artifact already persisted when ghost renders |
| Research | Separate `generateContent` call, NOT Live API inline search |
| Calendar auth | Pre-authorized test account |
| Proactive Audio | Enabled in config, BUT silent crystallization must work without it |
| Thinking budget | 512 tokens |
| Silence duration | 700ms (500ms for demo recording) |

---

## File Ownership Patterns

When reserving files, use these patterns:

| Track | Files |
|-------|-------|
| Canvas UI | `components/Canvas.tsx`, `components/ArtifactCard.tsx`, `components/DagEdge.tsx`, `components/JobNode.tsx`, `components/CanvasReplay.tsx`, `components/TranscriptPanel.tsx`, `components/Controls.tsx` |
| Audio pipeline | `lib/live/**`, `lib/audio/**` |
| Tool executor | `lib/tools/**` |
| Force layout | `lib/layout/**` |
| Replay | `lib/replay/**` |
| Firestore | `lib/firestore/**` |
| Calendar + Research | `lib/google/**` |
| Backend server | `app/api/**`, server WebSocket files |
| Non-code | `scripts/deploy.sh`, `docs/**`, `public/architecture.png` |

**Do not modify files outside your reservation without coordinating via agent-mail.**

---

## Bead Completion Criteria

A bead is DONE when:
1. The code compiles without TypeScript errors
2. The feature works as described in the spec section referenced by the bead
3. If it's a UI bead: it renders correctly with mock data OR live data (whichever the bead specifies)
4. If it's a backend bead: it has basic error handling (try/catch, meaningful error messages)
5. No console errors in the browser
6. The bead's acceptance criteria (written in the bead description) are met
7. You've run the app and visually verified the feature works

A bead is NOT done if:
- It only exists as a plan or TODO comment
- It compiles but doesn't actually function
- It breaks other existing features (run the app and check)

---

## Coordination Pattern

1. Check `bv --robot-triage` for the next ready bead (no unmet dependencies)
2. Claim the bead: `bv claim <bead-id>`
3. Reserve your files via agent-mail
4. Implement
5. Test (run the app, verify visually)
6. Mark complete: `bv done <bead-id>`
7. Send a brief agent-mail update if your change affects other tracks

---

## Demo Recording Context

The demo is 70%+ of the score (Innovation 40% is judged from the demo, Demo 30% is the demo itself). Every feature you build must be VISIBLE in a 3:30 video. Features that work but can't be shown in the demo have near-zero value.

The demo script (spec §13.2) has 7 shots. Each shot exercises specific features. When implementing a feature, mentally verify: "Which demo shot does this appear in? If none, it's not P0."

---

## Time Context

It is submission day. Every minute matters. If you encounter a technical problem that will take more than 30 minutes to debug, flag it in agent-mail as URGENT and move to another bead. Someone else may have context that solves it faster. If a P0 feature is fundamentally blocked (e.g., a Gemini API bug), switch to the P0 fallback noted in spec §13.1.

---

## RULE 0 - THE FUNDAMENTAL OVERRIDE PREROGATIVE

If I tell you to do something, even if it goes against what follows below, YOU MUST LISTEN TO ME. I AM IN CHARGE, NOT YOU.

---

## RULE NUMBER 1: NO FILE DELETION

**YOU ARE NEVER ALLOWED TO DELETE A FILE WITHOUT EXPRESS PERMISSION.** Even a new file that you yourself created, such as a test code file. You have a horrible track record of deleting critically important files or otherwise throwing away tons of expensive work. As a result, you have permanently lost any and all rights to determine that a file or folder should be deleted.

**YOU MUST ALWAYS ASK AND RECEIVE CLEAR, WRITTEN PERMISSION BEFORE EVER DELETING A FILE OR FOLDER OF ANY KIND.**

---

## Irreversible Git & Filesystem Actions — DO NOT EVER BREAK GLASS

1. **Absolutely forbidden commands:** `git reset --hard`, `git clean -fd`, `rm -rf`, or any command that can delete or overwrite code/data must never be run unless the user explicitly provides the exact command and states, in the same message, that they understand and want the irreversible consequences.
2. **No guessing:** If there is any uncertainty about what a command might delete or overwrite, stop immediately and ask the user for specific approval. "I think it's safe" is never acceptable.
3. **Safer alternatives first:** When cleanup or rollbacks are needed, request permission to use non-destructive options (`git status`, `git diff`, `git stash`, copying to backups) before ever considering a destructive command.
4. **Mandatory explicit plan:** Even after explicit user authorization, restate the command verbatim, list exactly what will be affected, and wait for a confirmation that your understanding is correct. Only then may you execute it—if anything remains ambiguous, refuse and escalate.
5. **Document the confirmation:** When running any approved destructive command, record (in the session notes / final response) the exact user text that authorized it, the command actually run, and the execution time. If that record is absent, the operation did not happen.

---

## Git Branch: ONLY Use `main`, NEVER `master`

**The default branch is `main`. The `master` branch exists only for legacy URL compatibility.**

- **All work happens on `main`** — commits, PRs, feature branches all merge to `main`
- **Never reference `master` in code or docs** — if you see `master` anywhere, it's a bug that needs fixing
- **The `master` branch must stay synchronized with `main`** — after pushing to `main`, also push to `master`:
  ```bash
  git push origin main:master
  ```

**If you see `master` referenced anywhere:**
1. Update it to `main`
2. Ensure `master` is synchronized: `git push origin main:master`

---

## Toolchain: Bun & Next.js

Use **bun** for everything JS/TS. Never use `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`.

- **Runtime:** Bun
- **Framework:** Next.js (App Router)
- **Lockfiles:** Only `bun.lock`. Do not introduce any other lockfile.
- **Note:** `bun install -g <pkg>` is valid syntax (alias for `bun add -g`). Do not "fix" it.

---

## Code Editing Discipline

### No Script-Based Changes

**NEVER** run a script that processes/changes code files in this repo. Brittle regex-based transformations create far more problems than they solve.

- **Always make code changes manually**, even when there are many instances
- For many simple changes: use parallel subagents
- For subtle/complex changes: do them methodically yourself

### No File Proliferation

If you want to change something or add a feature, **revise existing code files in place**.

**NEVER** create variations like:
- `Canvas_v2.tsx`
- `Canvas_improved.tsx`
- `Canvas_enhanced.tsx`

New files are reserved for **genuinely new functionality** that makes zero sense to include in any existing file. The bar for creating new files is **incredibly high**.

---

## Backwards Compatibility

We do not care about backwards compatibility—we're in early development with no users. We want to do things the **RIGHT** way with **NO TECH DEBT**.

- Never create "compatibility shims"
- Never create wrapper functions for deprecated APIs
- Just fix the code directly

---

## Compiler Checks (CRITICAL)

**After any substantive code changes, you MUST verify no errors were introduced:**

```bash
# TypeScript type-check
bun run tsc --noEmit

# Next.js lint
bun run lint

# Build verification
bun run build
```

If you see errors, **carefully understand and resolve each issue**. Read sufficient context to fix them the RIGHT way.

---

## Third-Party Library Usage

If you aren't 100% sure how to use a third-party library, **SEARCH ONLINE** to find the latest documentation and current best practices.

---

## MCP Agent Mail — Multi-Agent Coordination

A mail-like layer that lets coding agents coordinate asynchronously via MCP tools and resources. Provides identities, inbox/outbox, searchable threads, and advisory file reservations with human-auditable artifacts in Git.

### Why It's Useful

- **Prevents conflicts:** Explicit file reservations (leases) for files/globs
- **Token-efficient:** Messages stored in per-project archive, not in context
- **Quick reads:** `resource://inbox/...`, `resource://thread/...`

### Same Repository Workflow

1. **Register identity:**
   ```
   ensure_project(project_key=<abs-path>)
   register_agent(project_key, program, model)
   ```

2. **Reserve files before editing:**
   ```
   file_reservation_paths(project_key, agent_name, ["components/**"], ttl_seconds=3600, exclusive=true)
   ```

3. **Communicate with threads:**
   ```
   send_message(..., thread_id="FEAT-123")
   fetch_inbox(project_key, agent_name)
   acknowledge_message(project_key, agent_name, message_id)
   ```

4. **Quick reads:**
   ```
   resource://inbox/{Agent}?project=<abs-path>&limit=20
   resource://thread/{id}?project=<abs-path>&include_bodies=true
   ```

### Macros vs Granular Tools

- **Prefer macros for speed:** `macro_start_session`, `macro_prepare_thread`, `macro_file_reservation_cycle`, `macro_contact_handshake`
- **Use granular tools for control:** `register_agent`, `file_reservation_paths`, `send_message`, `fetch_inbox`, `acknowledge_message`

### Common Pitfalls

- `"from_agent not registered"`: Always `register_agent` in the correct `project_key` first
- `"FILE_RESERVATION_CONFLICT"`: Adjust patterns, wait for expiry, or use non-exclusive reservation
- **Auth errors:** If JWT+JWKS enabled, include bearer token with matching `kid`

---

## Beads (br) — Dependency-Aware Issue Tracking

Beads provides a lightweight, dependency-aware issue database and CLI (`br` - beads_rust) for selecting "ready work," setting priorities, and tracking status. It complements MCP Agent Mail's messaging and file reservations.

**Important:** `br` is non-invasive—it NEVER runs git commands automatically. You must manually commit changes after `br sync --flush-only`.

### Conventions

- **Single source of truth:** Beads for task status/priority/dependencies; Agent Mail for conversation and audit
- **Shared identifiers:** Use Beads issue ID (e.g., `br-123`) as Mail `thread_id` and prefix subjects with `[br-123]`
- **Reservations:** When starting a task, call `file_reservation_paths()` with the issue ID in `reason`

### Typical Agent Flow

1. **Pick ready work (Beads):**
   ```bash
   br ready --json  # Choose highest priority, no blockers
   ```

2. **Reserve edit surface (Mail):**
   ```
   file_reservation_paths(project_key, agent_name, ["components/**"], ttl_seconds=3600, exclusive=true, reason="br-123")
   ```

3. **Announce start (Mail):**
   ```
   send_message(..., thread_id="br-123", subject="[br-123] Start: <title>", ack_required=true)
   ```

4. **Work and update:** Reply in-thread with progress

5. **Complete and release:**
   ```bash
   br close 123 --reason "Completed"
   br sync --flush-only  # Export to JSONL (no git operations)
   ```
   ```
   release_file_reservations(project_key, agent_name, paths=["components/**"])
   ```
   Final Mail reply: `[br-123] Completed` with summary

### Mapping Cheat Sheet

| Concept | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Mail `thread_id` | `br-###` |
| Mail subject | `[br-###] ...` |
| File reservation `reason` | `br-###` |
| Commit messages | Include `br-###` for traceability |

## bv — Graph-Aware Triage Engine

bv is a graph-aware triage engine for Beads projects (`.beads/issues.jsonl`). It computes PageRank, betweenness, critical path, cycles, HITS, eigenvector, and k-core metrics deterministically.

**Scope boundary:** bv handles *what to work on* (triage, priority, planning). For agent-to-agent coordination (messaging, work claiming, file reservations), use MCP Agent Mail.

**CRITICAL: Use ONLY `--robot-*` flags. Bare `bv` launches an interactive TUI that blocks your session.**

### The Workflow: Start With Triage

**`bv --robot-triage` is your single entry point.** It returns:
- `quick_ref`: at-a-glance counts + top 3 picks
- `recommendations`: ranked actionable items with scores, reasons, unblock info
- `quick_wins`: low-effort high-impact items
- `blockers_to_clear`: items that unblock the most downstream work
- `project_health`: status/type/priority distributions, graph metrics
- `commands`: copy-paste shell commands for next steps

```bash
bv --robot-triage        # THE MEGA-COMMAND: start here
bv --robot-next          # Minimal: just the single top pick + claim command
```

### Command Reference

**Planning:**
| Command | Returns |
|---------|---------|
| `--robot-plan` | Parallel execution tracks with `unblocks` lists |
| `--robot-priority` | Priority misalignment detection with confidence |

**Graph Analysis:**
| Command | Returns |
|---------|---------|
| `--robot-insights` | Full metrics: PageRank, betweenness, HITS, eigenvector, critical path, cycles, k-core, articulation points, slack |
| `--robot-label-health` | Per-label health: `health_level`, `velocity_score`, `staleness`, `blocked_count` |
| `--robot-label-flow` | Cross-label dependency: `flow_matrix`, `dependencies`, `bottleneck_labels` |
| `--robot-label-attention [--attention-limit=N]` | Attention-ranked labels |

**History & Change Tracking:**
| Command | Returns |
|---------|---------|
| `--robot-history` | Bead-to-commit correlations |
| `--robot-diff --diff-since <ref>` | Changes since ref: new/closed/modified issues, cycles |

**Other:**
| Command | Returns |
|---------|---------|
| `--robot-burndown <sprint>` | Sprint burndown, scope changes, at-risk items |
| `--robot-forecast <id\|all>` | ETA predictions with dependency-aware scheduling |
| `--robot-alerts` | Stale issues, blocking cascades, priority mismatches |
| `--robot-suggest` | Hygiene: duplicates, missing deps, label suggestions |
| `--robot-graph [--graph-format=json\|dot\|mermaid]` | Dependency graph export |
| `--export-graph <file.html>` | Interactive HTML visualization |

### Scoping & Filtering

```bash
bv --robot-plan --label canvas             # Scope to label's subgraph
bv --robot-insights --as-of HEAD~30        # Historical point-in-time
bv --recipe actionable --robot-plan        # Pre-filter: ready to work
bv --recipe high-impact --robot-triage     # Pre-filter: top PageRank
bv --robot-triage --robot-triage-by-track  # Group by parallel work streams
bv --robot-triage --robot-triage-by-label  # Group by domain
```

### Understanding Robot Output

**All robot JSON includes:**
- `data_hash` — Fingerprint of source issues.jsonl
- `status` — Per-metric state: `computed|approx|timeout|skipped` + elapsed ms
- `as_of` / `as_of_commit` — Present when using `--as-of`

**Two-phase analysis:**
- **Phase 1 (instant):** degree, topo sort, density
- **Phase 2 (async, 500ms timeout):** PageRank, betweenness, HITS, eigenvector, cycles

### jq Quick Reference

```bash
bv --robot-triage | jq '.quick_ref'                        # At-a-glance summary
bv --robot-triage | jq '.recommendations[0]'               # Top recommendation
bv --robot-plan | jq '.plan.summary.highest_impact'        # Best unblock target
bv --robot-insights | jq '.status'                         # Check metric readiness
bv --robot-insights | jq '.Cycles'                         # Circular deps (must fix!)
```

## UBS — Ultimate Bug Scanner

**Golden Rule:** `ubs <changed-files>` before every commit. Exit 0 = safe. Exit >0 = fix & re-run.

### Commands

```bash
ubs file.tsx file2.ts                   # Specific files (< 1s) — USE THIS
ubs $(git diff --name-only --cached)    # Staged files — before commit
ubs --only=js,typescript src/           # Language filter (3-5x faster)
ubs --ci --fail-on-warning .            # CI mode — before PR
ubs .                                   # Whole project (ignores node_modules)
```

### Output Format

```
⚠️  Category (N errors)
    file.tsx:42:5 – Issue description
    💡 Suggested fix
Exit code: 1
```

Parse: `file:line:col` → location | 💡 → how to fix | Exit 0/1 → pass/fail

### Fix Workflow

1. Read finding → category + fix suggestion
2. Navigate `file:line:col` → view context
3. Verify real issue (not false positive)
4. Fix root cause (not symptom)
5. Re-run `ubs <file>` → exit 0
6. Commit

### Bug Severity

- **Critical (always fix):** Null safety, XSS/injection, async/await, memory leaks
- **Important (production):** Type narrowing, division-by-zero, resource leaks
- **Contextual (judgment):** TODO/FIXME, console.log debugging

---

## ast-grep vs ripgrep

**Use `ast-grep` when structure matters.** It parses code and matches AST nodes, ignoring comments/strings, and can **safely rewrite** code.

- Refactors/codemods: rename APIs, change import forms
- Policy checks: enforce patterns across a repo
- Editor/automation: LSP mode, `--json` output

**Use `ripgrep` when text is enough.** Fastest way to grep literals/regex.

- Recon: find strings, TODOs, log lines, config values
- Pre-filter: narrow candidate files before ast-grep

### Rule of Thumb

- Need correctness or **applying changes** → `ast-grep`
- Need raw speed or **hunting text** → `rg`
- Often combine: `rg` to shortlist files, then `ast-grep` to match/modify

### TypeScript Examples

```bash
# Find structured code (ignores comments)
ast-grep run -l TypeScript -p 'import $X from "$P"'

# Find all useState calls
ast-grep run -l TypeScript -p 'useState($INIT)'

# Codemod: rename an import
ast-grep run -l TypeScript -p 'import { $X } from "old-pkg"' -r 'import { $X } from "new-pkg"' -U

# Quick textual hunt
rg -n 'console.log' -t ts

# Combine speed + precision
rg -l -t ts 'useEffect' | xargs ast-grep run -l TypeScript -p 'useEffect($FN, [])' --json
```

## Morph Warp Grep — AI-Powered Code Search

**Use `mcp__morph-mcp__warp_grep` for exploratory "how does X work?" questions.** An AI agent expands your query, greps the codebase, reads relevant files, and returns precise line ranges with full context.

**Use `ripgrep` for targeted searches.** When you know exactly what you're looking for.

**Use `ast-grep` for structural patterns.** When you need AST precision for matching/rewriting.

### When to Use What

| Scenario | Tool | Why |
|----------|------|-----|
| "How does the audio pipeline work?" | `warp_grep` | Exploratory; don't know where to start |
| "Where is the force layout logic?" | `warp_grep` | Need to understand architecture |
| "Find all uses of `useCanvas`" | `ripgrep` | Targeted literal search |
| "Find files with `console.log`" | `ripgrep` | Simple pattern |
| "Replace all `var` with `let`" | `ast-grep` | Structural refactor |

### warp_grep Usage

```
mcp__morph-mcp__warp_grep(
  repoPath: "/home/ubuntu/eureka-canvas",
  query: "How does the WebSocket proxy to Gemini Live API work?"
)
```

Returns structured results with file paths, line ranges, and extracted code snippets.

### Anti-Patterns

- **Don't** use `warp_grep` to find a specific function name → use `ripgrep`
- **Don't** use `ripgrep` to understand "how does X work" → wastes time with manual reads
- **Don't** use `ripgrep` for codemods → risks collateral edits

## cass — Cross-Agent Session Search

`cass` indexes prior agent conversations (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini, ChatGPT, etc.) so we can reuse solved problems.

**Rules:** Never run bare `cass` (TUI). Always use `--robot` or `--json`.

### Examples

```bash
cass health
cass search "audio pipeline" --robot --limit 5
cass view /path/to/session.jsonl -n 42 --json
cass expand /path/to/session.jsonl -n 42 -C 3 --json
cass capabilities --json
cass robot-docs guide
```

### Tips

- Use `--fields minimal` for lean output
- Filter by agent with `--agent`
- Use `--days N` to limit to recent history

stdout is data-only, stderr is diagnostics; exit code 0 means success.

Treat cass as a way to avoid re-solving problems other agents already handled.

## Auxiliary Tools

### DCG — Destructive Command Guard

DCG is a Claude Code hook that **blocks dangerous git and filesystem commands** before execution. Sub-millisecond latency, mechanical enforcement.

**Golden Rule:** DCG works automatically. When a dangerous command is blocked, use safer alternatives or ask the user to run it manually.

```bash
dcg test "<cmd>" [--explain]          # Test if a command would be blocked
dcg packs [--enabled] [--verbose]     # List packs
dcg allow-once <code>                 # One-time bypass code
dcg doctor [--fix] [--format json]    # Health check + auto-fix

## Beads Workflow Integration

This project uses [beads_rust](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust) (`br`) for issue tracking. Issues are stored in `.beads/` and tracked in git. Source of truth is `.beads/issues.jsonl` (exported from `beads.db`).

**Important:** `br` is non-invasive—it NEVER executes git commands. After `br sync --flush-only`, you must manually run `git add .beads/ && git commit`.

### Essential Commands

```bash
# View issues (launches TUI - avoid in automated sessions)
bv

# CLI commands for agents (use these instead)
br ready              # Show issues ready to work (no blockers)
br list --status=open # All open issues
br show <id>          # Full issue details with dependencies
br create --title="..." --type=task --priority=2
br update <id> --status=in_progress
br close <id> --reason "Completed"
br close <id1> <id2>  # Close multiple issues at once
br sync --flush-only  # Export to JSONL (NO git operations)
```

### Workflow Pattern

1. **Start**: Run `br ready` to find actionable work
2. **Claim**: Use `br update <id> --status=in_progress`
3. **Work**: Implement the task
4. **Complete**: Use `br close <id>`
5. **Sync**: Run `br sync --flush-only` then manually commit

### Key Concepts

- **Dependencies**: Issues can block other issues. `br ready` shows only unblocked work.
- **Priority**: P0=critical, P1=high, P2=medium, P3=low, P4=backlog (use numbers, not words)
- **Types**: task, bug, feature, epic, question, docs
- **Blocking**: `br dep add <issue> <depends-on>` to add dependencies

### Session Protocol

**Before ending any session, run this checklist:**

```bash
git status              # Check what changed
git add <files>         # Stage code changes
br sync --flush-only    # Export beads to JSONL
git add .beads/         # Stage beads changes
git commit -m "..."     # Commit everything together
git push                # Push to remote
```

### Best Practices

- Check `br ready` at session start to find available work
- Update status as you work (in_progress → closed)
- Create new issues with `br create` when you discover tasks
- Use descriptive titles and set appropriate priority/type
- Always `br sync --flush-only && git add .beads/` before ending session

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **Sync beads** - `br sync --flush-only` to export to JSONL
5. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

Note for Codex/GPT-5.2:

You constantly bother me and stop working with concerned questions that look similar to this:

```
Unexpected changes (need guidance)

- Working tree still shows edits I did not make in package.json, bun.lock, components/Canvas.tsx. Please advise whether to keep/commit/revert these before any further work. I did not touch them.

Next steps (pick one)

1. Decide how to handle the unrelated modified files above so we can resume cleanly.
```

NEVER EVER DO THAT AGAIN. The answer is literally ALWAYS the same: those are changes created by the potentially dozen of other agents working on the project at the same time. This is not only a common occurrence, it happens multiple times PER MINUTE. The way to deal with it is simple: you NEVER, under ANY CIRCUMSTANCE, stash, revert, overwrite, or otherwise disturb in ANY way the work of other agents. Just treat those changes identically to changes that you yourself made. Just fool yourself into thinking YOU made the changes and simply don't recall it for some reason.

## Note on Built-in TODO Functionality

Also, if I ask you to explicitly use your built-in TODO functionality, don't complain about this and say you need to use beads. You can use built-in TODOs if I tell you specifically to do so. Always comply with such orders.
